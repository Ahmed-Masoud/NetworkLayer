# Network Layer

## Description
This is a generic network layer using Alamofire and Object Mapper based on Moya concepts but just a lightweighted version

## Usage
You can really use this in any way that you like or feel comfortable with the basic structure is that we have 2 generic functions one that promises a decoded response and the other is just an optimistic call were we dont care about the response just to know if the call succeded or failed 
Also provided with the repo BaseResponse files whic can be editedeasily to map you Backend responses and an optional BaseError just in case you have a diffrent structure for the failure response
